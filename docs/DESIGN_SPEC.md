# Enterprise Asset Intelligence — Enterprise Design Specification

**Status:** v1.0 (Stage 1 deliverable) · companion to [AUDIT_FINDINGS.md](AUDIT_FINDINGS.md)
**Audience:** builder model / engineering team + technical-diligence reviewers.
Finding IDs (ML-1, SEC-1, …) reference the audit; every design decision here states which gap it closes.

## 1. Product Vision & Users

### Vision

**The vendor-agnostic asset-intelligence layer for mixed construction fleets.** Every OEM sells a
telematics silo (Cat VisionLink, Komatsu KOMTRAX, Deere JDLink); none of them scores a *mixed* fleet,
and none covers the 30–60% of rental iron that has no telematics at all. Enterprise Asset
Intelligence unifies telemetry, maintenance history, and rental operations across brands — including
un-telematized assets via operational proxies (rental hours, service events) — into one risk model,
one work queue, and one ROI narrative.

**The wedge is economic, not algorithmic.** For an equipment-rental company, an unplanned failure on
rent is: lost rental revenue (the unit's daily rate × downtime), a stranded jobsite (customer's crew
idle → churn), an emergency service call at premium cost, and a possible swap dispatch. A predicted
failure converted to a scheduled PM during a rental gap costs one service visit. The product's core
KPI is therefore **avoided downtime dollars**, computed per intervention and rolled up per fleet —
not model AUC.

### Personas & jobs-to-be-done

| Persona | JTBD | Product surface |
|---|---|---|
| **Fleet / maintenance manager** (primary) | "Tell me which of my 400 units will hurt me next, why, and what to do this week within my shop capacity." | Fleet command center: ranked risk queue, explanation panel, one-click work-order creation, weekly PM plan. |
| **Ops / rental dispatcher** | "Don't let me send a unit that will die on a customer's site." | Dispatch risk guard at rental creation (exists today — keep), swap suggestions. |
| **Service technician** | "What am I inspecting and why on this unit?" | Work order with the model's drivers translated to inspection points; outcome capture (`eventSource`, findings) that feeds labels. |
| **Ops director / owner** | "Prove this subscription pays for itself." | ROI report: interventions taken, failures avoided vs. baseline, downtime dollars saved, utilization. |
| **(Internal) ML operator** | "Is the model healthy; can I promote the challenger?" | ML ops dashboard (exists — fix metric honesty per ML-9). |

### Value narrative (the demo storyline)

1. Connect (or simulate) a mixed fleet → unified asset registry.
2. Risk queue ranks 400 units; top unit is HIGH with drivers a mechanic recognizes (hours since
   service, wear trend, jobsite severity).
3. Manager schedules PM in the unit's rental gap; technician logs outcome.
4. ROI card shows the counterfactual: expected failure cost vs. PM cost actually spent.
5. Dispatcher tries to rent a HIGH unit → guard forces acknowledgement or swap.

## 2. System Architecture

### Shape (target = today's shape, hardened)

Three deployables + one database; the ML service is a versioned, swappable component behind a stable
inference contract. No new infrastructure until Phase B; the fixes are at the boundaries.

```

   • /train, /models/*, /drift/*     (admin plane)
   • registry/ artifact store (versioned bundles)
   • Groq LLM (optional, flagged)
```

### Boundary decisions (each maps to an audit gap)

1. **Single DDL owner (closes ARCH-1).** Drizzle generates real migrations (baseline from current
   schema, then `sensor_data_logs` and the three drift tables move into `shared/schema.ts`). The
   Python service gets DB *DML* access only; its `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` blocks are deleted.
   Quickstart uses `drizzle-kit migrate` and actually works from a clean database.
2. **The inference contract is the only ML↔gateway coupling.** One JSON schema, one place: a
   `shared/contracts/prediction.json` (JSON Schema) from which the pydantic model and a zod schema
   are both generated/validated in CI (closes the ML-10 drift and QA-1 contract gap). Contract is
   versioned (`contract_version` in payload); the ML service rejects unknown majors.
3. **ML service is private (closes SEC-1).** No host port in compose; Node reaches it by service
   DNS. All ML-service endpoints require `X-Service-Token` (from env, rotated with the rest). Admin
   verbs (`/train`, `/models/promote`, `/drift/compute-reference`) additionally log actor identity
   passed through from the Node session (`X-Actor: userId`) into an audit table.
4. **Model artifacts are a bundle, not loose files (closes ML-7).** A version = one directory
   `registry/v1.15/` containing models, encoder, clip thresholds, feature list, metadata, drift
   reference, and a `manifest.json` with content hashes. The predictor loads *only* from the pinned
   bundle; nothing is resolved latest-by-glob; nothing unversioned is ever overwritten.
5. **Failure semantics.** Node→ML calls: 10s timeout (exists), one retry on connection error only
   (never on 5xx from training), circuit-breaker state surfaced on `/api/health`. If ML is down:
   reads serve last stored predictions with a `stale: true` flag and UI banner; writes (rescore,
   train) fail loudly. No silent hardcoded fallbacks (deletes `getDefaultMetrics()` behavior, ML-9).
6. **Start-order decoupling.** Compose healthchecks exist; additionally the gateway boots without
   ML (degraded mode) instead of `depends_on` hard ordering, and the seed pipeline polls
   `running/last_result` correctly (OPS-1).
7. **Batch scoring is a job, not a request loop (closes ARCH-3).** `POST /api/ml/score-fleet`
   enqueues; the gateway assembles features set-based (one SQL pass per window, all assets), ships
   ≤500-row chunks to the batch endpoint; FastAPI vectorizes `predict_proba` + SHAP over the frame
   and runs it in a worker thread. Progress is pollable (same UX as training today).

### Reliability / scalability / adaptability / maintainability deltas

Covered as concrete patterns in §7 (the -ilities matrix). Headline: the architecture stays a
modular monolith + one model service; horizontal scale-out (queue workers, multi-tenant sharding)
is a Phase B seam, deliberately not built now.

---

## 3. ML System & Data Science (the core)

### 3.1 Leakage-free methodology — enforced and tested

**Point-in-time feature correctness (fixes ML-1).**
- Every feature query takes `snapshotTs` and applies `event_date <= snapshotTs` (and window lower
  bound). Rental-day accumulation clamps `end = min(returnDate ?? snapshotTs, snapshotTs)`.
- The feature module exposes exactly one public function:
  `buildSnapshot(equipmentId, asOf: Date): FeatureVector` — used by backfill, live scoring, cron,
  and the batch route (today four call sites duplicate payload assembly; they all converge here).
- **Enforcement test (CI):** a frozen fixture DB; assert `buildSnapshot(eq, T)` is *bit-identical*
  whether or not events after `T` exist in the DB (insert future rows, recompute, diff). This is
  the regression test that would have caught ML-1.

**Split protocol (fixes ML-3).**
- Temporal holdout: last 20% by `snapshot_ts` **with an embargo**: drop dev rows whose label window
  `[ts, ts+h]` crosses the boundary (per horizon).
- **Grouped reporting:** alongside the temporal metrics, a `GroupKFold`-by-asset evaluation is
  computed and published in the same metadata file (`by_asset` block). Deployment claim discipline:
  temporal metrics answer "same fleet, next quarter"; grouped metrics answer "new fleet, day one"
  (the sales scenario). Both go on the dashboard.
- CV stays `TimeSeriesSplit(5, gap=horizon)` on the dev set.
- **Leakage canaries (CI):** (a) shuffled-label training must produce holdout AUC ≈ 0.5 ± 0.05;
  (b) a `snapshot_ts`-only model (timestamp as sole feature) must not beat prevalence baseline
  materially — catches split-adjacent artifacts.

**Transforms fit on dev only (fixes ML-4)** — clip thresholds, encoder, caps computed inside the
split, serialized into the version bundle, applied identically at serve (see 3.4).

### 3.2 Labeling (fixes ML-2 / ML-11)

- **Failure definition:** a maintenance event with `eventSource = 'REACTIVE_REPAIR'` (unit failed in
  service), or a rental cut short with a swap whose reason is mechanical (equipment_swaps.reason
  taxonomy to be added). `SCHEDULED_PM` MAJOR_SERVICE is *not* a failure — it's the outcome we're
  trying to cause.
- **Windows:** `will_fail_h = 1` iff a failure event occurs in `(ts, ts+h]` (day-0 excluded — the
  same-day event already influenced the features).
- **Censoring:** rows with `ts + 60d > cursor` stay unlabeled (already correct today — keep), and
  *retired* assets are labeled only up to retirement date.
- **Intervention handling (the feedback-loop problem):** when a model-driven
  `PREDICTIVE_INTERVENTION` lands inside a label window, the row is **censored, not negative** —
  we don't know whether it would have failed. Store `label_status ∈ {observed, censored_intervention,
  censored_horizon}` on the snapshot so prevalence accounting stays honest. (This is the standard
  treatment-leakage guard in deployed PdM programs; without it the model degrades precisely because
  people act on it.)
- **Synthetic-data honesty:** while data comes from the simulator, every metrics surface (README,
  dashboard, metadata) carries `data_source: simulated`. Simulator metrics validate plumbing; they
  are never quoted as expected field performance. The circularity (labels generated from features)
  is documented in the README as a known property of the demo environment.

### 3.3 Evaluation & calibration (fixes ML-5, ML-9)

- **Class imbalance:** at 20–27% prevalence, drop SMOTE; keep `class_weight='balanced'`. (If real
  data lands at <5%, reconsider — inside folds only, never before calibration.)
- **Calibration:** `CalibratedClassifierCV` fit on non-resampled data; publish a **reliability
  curve + Brier score** per horizon in metadata and on the ML dashboard. Acceptance gate: expected
  calibration error < 0.05 on holdout.
- **Metrics that matter for maintenance,** reported per horizon on the temporal holdout *and*
  grouped-by-asset split:
  - Recall on failure class at the operating threshold (missed failures are the expensive error).
  - **Precision@budget:** precision within the top-K units the shop can actually service per week
    (K configurable; default 10% of fleet) — the honest "will my mechanic trust the queue" number.
  - **Lead time:** distribution of (first HIGH flag → failure event) in days; median must exceed
    the PM scheduling latency (default 7d) to be operationally useful.
  - PR-AUC, ROC-AUC, Brier — secondary, for trend tracking.
- **Storage/display:** replace the shoehorned `model_training_metrics` columns with a long-format
  `model_metrics(model_version, horizon, split ∈ {temporal, by_asset}, metric, value)` table.
  Dashboard renders per-horizon binary confusion matrices and never averages AUCs into "precision."
  Delete `getDefaultMetrics()` and the hardcoded feature-importance route — empty states instead.
- **Threshold governance:** LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH cutoffs (0.30/0.60 today) become per-horizon config
  chosen from the calibrated holdout to hit a target precision@budget, stored in the version bundle
  with the rationale; the UI shows "HIGH means ≥X% calibrated probability."

### 3.4 Feature governance — single source of truth (fixes ML-6, ML-10, ML-8)

- **One definition module:** `server/features/` (TypeScript) is the *only* implementation of raw
  feature semantics. It emits the raw `FeatureVector`.
- **One transform pipeline:** Python owns *model-space* transforms (encode, clip, log) as a single
  ordered function serialized into the version bundle (`transforms.json`: ordered steps + params).
  Training and the predictor call the same function; unit test asserts
  `predictor.transform == training.transform` on a fixture frame.
- **One imputation table:** defaults (`days_since=999`, `mtbf=500`, …) live in the shared contract;
  Node stops re-implementing them per call site.
- **Projector correctness:** `_age_snapshot` ages only *raw* fields (age, days-since, hours via
  hours_velocity) and re-derives everything else by calling the shared derivation, then the shared
  transform. Property test: projection at day 0 == live prediction for the same snapshot.
- **Contract test in CI:** Node emits a golden payload from the fixture DB → validated against the
  pydantic schema → column list asserted equal to the bundle's `feature_cols`.

### 3.5 Model lifecycle (hardens what exists)

- Registry keeps champion/challenger/retired + history (as today) but references **bundles** (§2.4).
- Promotion requires: challenger metadata present, calibration gate passed, and ≥N shadow batches
  with score-delta report (shadow scoring already exists — persist its summaries).
- Retraining triggers (keep monitor.py behavior): PSI ALERT on data/prediction/bias drift, or
  scheduled monthly, or manual. Auto-*train* is fine; auto-*promote* never.
- Drift: three-layer detection is good; add model-performance drift once real labels mature
  (rolling recall on realized outcomes — the labels arrive 10/30/60 days late by construction).
- Rollback: `POST /models/rollback` re-pins the previous champion bundle (bundle immutability makes
  this trivial).

### 3.6 Roadmap (Phase B seam, not stubbed in the hot path)

- **Richer telemetry features:** vibration/temperature trends already flow through
  `sensor_degradation_rate`; Phase B adds per-sensor rolling aggregates from the telemetry layer
  (§4) as *additional columns in the same FeatureVector contract* — no architectural change.
- **Survival / RUL models:** gradient-boosted survival or discrete-time hazard model as a second
  bundle type behind the same `/predict` contract (output adapter maps survival curve → per-horizon
  probabilities, which keeps the UI stable). The three-binary-classifier design is retained until a
  survival model beats it on precision@budget + lead time on real data.
- **Cost-optimal scheduling:** move the client-side cost model server-side, parameterize repair
  premium vs. PM cost per category (fixing the category-name mismatch), and optimize the weekly PM
  plan under shop-capacity constraints (small ILP; Phase B).

## 4. Vendor-Agnostic Telemetry Layer (the moat)

Design now, build in Phase B. The pattern is **ports-and-adapters into a canonical asset/telemetry
model**, mirroring how the AEMP 2.0 / ISO 15143-3 standard already frames mixed-fleet telematics —
adapters should consume AEMP feeds first (Cat, Komatsu, Deere all expose them) and vendor-native
APIs only where AEMP is insufficient.

```

                                        asset_identity(oem_id ↔ internal id, VIN/serial match)
                                        telemetry_readings(asset, ts, metric, value, unit, source, quality)
                                        utilization_daily(asset, date, hours, fuel, idle_pct, location)
                                                    │

                                        FeatureVector builder (§3.4) — same contract
```

Decisions:
- **Adapter contract:** each adapter implements `fetch(since) → RawRecord[]`, `normalize(RawRecord)
  → CanonicalReading[]`; adapters are config-registered per tenant fleet. Failures are per-adapter
  (one OEM outage never blocks the rest); each adapter reports freshness (`last_successful_sync`)
  surfaced on the fleet dashboard.
- **Canonical metric dictionary** with units (engine_hours, fuel_rate_lph, coolant_temp_c, …);
  vendor fields map into it; unmapped fields land in `raw` for later. Idempotent upserts keyed
  `(asset, metric, ts, source)`.
- **Asset identity resolution** is the hard, valuable part: match OEM feeds to internal assets by
  serial/VIN with a manual-review queue for ambiguous matches.
- **Un-telematized assets** are first-class: `utilization_daily` derives from rentals + operator
  hour-meter entries (mobile-friendly form); features degrade gracefully via the `quality` field —
  a per-asset **data-confidence score** shown next to risk (never present a low-data score with the
  same visual authority; see §5).
- The current `sensor_data_logs` simulator becomes just another adapter (`source='simulator'`),
  which keeps the demo path and the future real path identical.

---

## 5. UX / UI Design (investment-grade)

### Information architecture

1. **Fleet command center** (landing): KPI strip (fleet health index, HIGH count with Δ, predicted
   downtime dollars at risk, PM backlog); ranked **risk queue** (the core object: unit, category,
   risk per horizon as compact tri-band, top driver in plain words, lead-time estimate,
   data-confidence, action button); filters by category/site/status; density toggle.
2. **Asset detail**: header (identity, status, rental state) → risk panel (three horizons with
   calibrated probability + trend arrow + projection sparkline with HIGH-crossing marker) →
   **explanation panel** → maintenance/rental timeline (event-source badges) → sensor trends.
3. **Explainability surface (trust-critical):** SHAP already computed per prediction — surface it as
   a horizontal contribution bar chart: signed bars ("+21% Wear rate accelerating", "−8% Recently
   serviced"), each expandable to the raw feature value vs. fleet baseline. Kill the current dual
   system where heuristic "drivers" (hardcoded thresholds) masquerade as model attribution (ML-9
   adjacent): one attribution source (SHAP), one phrase dictionary mapping features → mechanic
   language. Confidence & provenance line under every score: "v1.15 · trained 2026-03-14 ·
   calibrated · data confidence: high (telemetry + full history)".
4. **Action loop:** from risk panel → "Schedule PM" creates a work order pre-filled with inspection
   points derived from top drivers; completing it writes `maintenanceEvents` with
   `eventSource='PREDICTIVE_INTERVENTION'` (closing the label loop §3.2); ROI card accrues the
   avoided-cost estimate.
5. **ML ops dashboard** (admin): keep, but honest (per-horizon binary confusion matrices,
   reliability curves, precision@budget, drift cards, champion/challenger compare, promote/rollback
   with confirmation + audit trail).

### Design language (tokens, direction)

- **Type:** Inter (UI) + JetBrains Mono (numerals/IDs); numeric tables use tabular-nums.
- **Color:** neutral slate surface ramp; **semantic risk is the only saturated color**: HIGH
  `#DC2626`, MEDIUM `#D97706`, LOW `#059669` (AA on both themes), plus a blue reserved for
  interactive elements — risk colors never used decoratively. Dark mode default for the command
  center (`data-theme` switch; tokens as CSS variables).
- **Recharts styling:** one shared theme module (axis/grid at 40% neutral, 1.5px series strokes,
  risk-band reference areas on projection charts, tooltip = card tokens). Sparklines inline in the
  queue rows.
- **Components:** shadcn/ui as today; add `RiskBadge` (tri-horizon compact), `DriverBar`,
  `ConfidenceTag`, `FreshnessDot` (telemetry staleness).
- **Empty/degraded states:** every ML surface has a real empty state ("no model yet — run
  pipeline") instead of fabricated defaults; stale predictions get a visible banner (§2.5).

---

## 6. Enterprise Non-Negotiables

| Concern | Decision (Phase A unless marked B) |
|---|---|
| **AuthN** | Keep session auth; enforce `SESSION_SECRET` (fail fast), persistent session store (mysql/redis-backed, not MemoryStore), bcrypt cost 12, rate-limit login. Remove unused passport/JWT deps or actually adopt them (decision: remove; JWT_SECRET is dead config today). SSO/OIDC = Phase B. |
| **AuthZ / RBAC** | Roles: ADMINISTRATOR, FLEET_MANAGER (new: can act on risk, schedule PM; cannot train/promote/reset), VIEWER. Server-side middleware per route group; ML admin verbs require ADMINISTRATOR + are proxied only (SEC-1: ML port private, S2S token). Fix `/api/admin/seed` to admin-only. |
| **Audit logging** | `audit_log(actor, action, entity, before/after, ts)` for: model promote/rollback/train, threshold changes, overrides (table exists — wire it into UI), resets, dispatch acknowledgements (currently a UI-only checkbox — persist who accepted HIGH-risk dispatch and when; it's the liability trail). |
| **Multi-tenancy** | Phase B: `tenant_id` on every table + row scoping middleware + per-tenant model bundles. Phase A prepares by never hardcoding fleet-wide singletons in new code (e.g., simulation_state id=1 pattern is quarantined to demo mode). |
| **Data lineage** | Every prediction row already stores model version — add `feature_snapshot_id` FK and `contract_version`; every snapshot stores `builder_version` (git sha). Bundles content-hashed (§2.4). That closes the loop: score → snapshot → code version. |
| **Observability** | Structured JSON logs (pino Node / structlog Python) with request IDs propagated Node→Python; drop full response-body logging (SEC-2); metrics endpoints (p95 latency, batch durations, drift status) — Prometheus format; Sentry-class error capture both services. Health endpoints already exist — extend with dependency status. |
| **Secrets** | Rotate everything in the current `.env` (SEC-2); `.env.example` only in repo; runtime injection via platform env; startup validation of required vars (Node & Python); timing-safe agent-key compare. |
| **CI/CD + IaC** | Keep the four CI jobs; add: leakage canaries + contract test + calibration gate (§3), `docker compose config` lint, image builds on tag. Add MySQL service to compose (today's compose can't actually run the stack); one-command `make demo`. Railway/host IaC = Phase B. |
| **MLOps** | Versioned immutable bundles; challenger-by-default with gated manual promotion (exists — harden per §3.5); drift → auto-train never auto-promote; rollback endpoint; MLflow optional as today; retention policy for prediction tables. |

## 7. Engineering-Principles Matrix

| -ility | Pattern adopted | Where it lands | Gap it closes | Trade-off rejected |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Reliability** | Immutable versioned model bundles + pinned resolution | `ml-service/registry/vX.Y/` + predictor loader | ML-7 (champion serving challenger's transforms) | "Latest file wins" convenience; also rejected DB-stored blobs (harder to inspect/diff) |
| **Reliability** | Degraded-mode reads + explicit staleness, no fabricated fallbacks | gateway `/api/ml/*` + UI banners | ML-9 (hardcoded default metrics), silent failure masking | Fail-closed everywhere (would blank the dashboard on every ML restart) |
| **Reliability** | Set-based labeling & batched scoring as jobs with progress | `labelSnapshots` SQL rewrite; score-fleet job | ARCH-3 (N+1 at fleet scale) | Full message-queue infra now (premature for 3 services; seam kept for Phase B) |
| **Reliability** | Leakage canaries + point-in-time fixture test in CI | `ml-ci.yml` new jobs | ML-1/ML-3 regression risk, QA-1 | Relying on code review to catch temporal bugs (it demonstrably didn't) |
| **Adaptability** | Ports-and-adapters for telemetry sources (AEMP-first) | §4 ingestion layer | vendor lock-in; simulator/real-data divergence | Per-OEM bespoke pipelines (moat becomes maintenance burden) |
| **Adaptability** | Stable inference contract + versioned schema, survival models as new bundle type behind same port | `shared/contracts/prediction.json` | ML-10 payload drift; future RUL migration cost | Letting each caller shape its own payload (three already diverged) |
| **Adaptability** | Config-as-data for thresholds/imputation in bundle | `transforms.json`, threshold config | ML-12 (dead config table), scattered constants | Hardcoded constants "for simplicity" |
| **Maintainability** | Single feature-definition module + single transform pipeline shared train/serve | `server/features/` + bundle transforms | ML-6 (transform-order skew), triplicated payload assembly, ML-8 (projector formulas) | Duplicating features in Python "to keep ML self-contained" — the duplication is the bug factory |
| **Maintainability** | One DDL owner (Drizzle migrations), Python DML-only | migrations baseline; delete runtime DDL | ARCH-1 (schema in 4 places, broken quickstart) | drizzle-kit push forever (no history, no rollback, no CI verify) |
| **Maintainability** | Typed contracts end-to-end (zod ↔ JSON Schema ↔ pydantic, CI-verified) | shared contracts + CI contract test | QA-1, ML-10 | Trusting field-name convention across languages |
| **Maintainability** | Dead-code and artifact hygiene budget (repo ≤ small MBs; artifacts external) | delete legacy risk-scoring path, orphan pyc, 250MB pickles → store/LFS | OPS-2 | Keeping history "for reference" inside the deployable repo |
| **Scalability** | Vectorized batch inference + SHAP off the event loop | FastAPI batch endpoint rewrite | ARCH-3 (per-row loop blocks asyncio) | Per-request SHAP microservice (overkill at this stage) |
| **Scalability** | Append tables get retention + `latest` views + real upserts | prediction/risk-score tables | ARCH-2 (unbounded duplicate growth) | Unbounded audit-everything storage |
| **Scalability** | Tenant-scoped data model as Phase B seam (tenant_id, per-tenant bundles) | schema evolution plan | single-fleet assumptions (simulation_state id=1) | Building multi-tenant now before first real tenant |
| **Security (cross-cutting)** | Private ML plane + S2S token + audit of admin verbs | compose network, FastAPI middleware | SEC-1 | mTLS/service mesh now (three services, one host) |

## 8. Migration / Refactor Plan

Phase A is **verify–harden–polish** of an already-built system; nothing here is a rewrite.
Ordering within phases is dependency order.

### Phase A — demo-polish / credibility (target: 2–3 focused weeks)

**A0 — Stop the bleeding (day 1)**
1. Rotate all secrets in `.env`; verify public-repo history (SEC-2). Fail-fast on missing secrets.
2. Fix `trainAndPoll` status polling (OPS-1) — demo onboarding must succeed end-to-end.
3. Remove ML-service host port; add S2S token middleware (SEC-1). Add MySQL to compose.

**A1 — ML correctness (the core of the phase)**
4. Bound every feature query to `snapshotTs` (ML-1); converge the four payload-assembly sites onto
   `buildSnapshot()`; add the point-in-time fixture test.
5. Labeling v2: eventSource-aware labels, day-0 exclusion, intervention censoring (ML-11/§3.2).
6. Split hygiene: embargo at holdout boundary; grouped-by-asset metrics reported (ML-3); transforms
   fit on dev only (ML-4).
7. Calibration fix: drop SMOTE, calibrate on real prevalence, publish reliability curves (ML-5).
8. Unify transforms into the bundle pipeline; fix predictor ordering; fix projector aging + day-0
   property test (ML-6, ML-8).
9. Bundle-ify the registry with pinned resolution (ML-7).
10. **Regenerate snapshots → retrain → publish honest metrics** with `data_source: simulated`
    framing everywhere (ML-2). Expect the AUCs to drop; that drop is the deliverable.

**A2 — Metric honesty & UX**
11. Long-format metrics table; dashboard: per-horizon confusion matrices, reliability curve,
    precision@budget; delete `getDefaultMetrics()` + hardcoded importance route; fix confidence
    labels (ML-9).
12. Explanation panel: SHAP-only attribution with plain-language dictionary; provenance line.
13. Risk queue upgrade + action loop writing `PREDICTIVE_INTERVENTION` events; persist dispatch
    acknowledgements.
14. Design tokens pass (semantic risk color, dark mode, chart theme).

**A3 — Repo & pipeline hygiene**
15. Drizzle migration baseline; move runtime DDL into schema (ARCH-1).
16. Set-based labeling; vectorized batch endpoint (ARCH-3); unique key + upsert or retention on
    prediction tables (ARCH-2).
17. Delete dead code (legacy risk scorer route usage, empty orchestrator file, orphan pyc, unused
    deps, duplicate seed scripts); move pickles out of git (OPS-2); README rewrite to match reality
    (metrics framing, quickstart that works, remove GenAI claim or wire it behind a flag — LLM-1).
18. CI additions: leakage canaries, contract test, calibration gate, compose lint (QA-1).

**Exit criteria for Phase A:** clean-clone quickstart works; seed completes; all CI gates green;
metrics on dashboard = metrics in metadata = metrics in README, all labeled simulated; no
unauthenticated path can mutate models.

### Phase B — enterprise / investment scale

1. **Telemetry ingestion layer** (§4): AEMP adapter framework, canonical model, identity
   resolution, data-confidence scoring; simulator becomes an adapter.
2. **Real-data validation program:** design partner fleet(s); labels from REACTIVE_REPAIR;
   baseline vs. calendar-PM comparison; the first honest field metrics (this, not features, is what
   converts diligence).
3. **Multi-tenancy:** tenant_id scoping, per-tenant bundles/thresholds, tenant admin.
4. **MLOps depth:** performance-drift on realized labels, scheduled retrains, shadow-report
   automation, canary scoring windows, model cards per bundle.
5. **Richer models:** sensor time-series aggregates → discrete-time hazard / survival bundle behind
   the same contract; capacity-constrained weekly PM optimizer; server-side cost model with repair
   premiums.
6. **Platform:** SSO/OIDC, Prometheus + tracing, IaC for the hosting target, backup/DR policy,
   uptime SLOs.

## Open questions & assumptions (running log)

See final report; key assumptions: MySQL stays (no Postgres migration in scope); Node remains the
feature-assembly owner (alternative — Python-side feature building against the DB — rejected to
keep one implementation next to the operational data model); demo/simulator remains a supported
first-class mode after Phase A.
