# Enterprise Asset Intelligence

**Live demo:** not yet deployed — see [Deployment Status](#deployment-status). Runs locally in a few minutes via [Quickstart](#quickstart).

Predictive maintenance platform for heavy construction equipment rental fleets — encoding the same failure-prediction and risk-scoring logic used in industrial and manufacturing equipment reliability programs. Asset degradation curves, hazard functions, and maintenance-interval optimization transfer directly from a production line's rotating equipment to a rental fleet's excavators and skid steers, which is the direct link to 26 years of CPG/manufacturing process engineering behind this project. It's a full-stack system that simulates fleet operations, engineers features from operational data, trains calibrated Random Forest models, and serves multi-horizon failure probability predictions across 10, 30, and 60-day windows — with cost-optimized intervention recommendations and a rental dispatch risk guard.

## Why This Project

This is the second of two portfolio repositories, deliberately built to be complementary rather than redundant:

- **FormulaForge** demonstrates LLM/RAG application engineering — retrieval pipelines, prompt design, grounding a model in a CPG formulation knowledge base.
- **Enterprise Asset Intelligence** (this repo) demonstrates classical ML + MLOps engineering — feature engineering from raw operational data, calibrated multi-horizon classifiers, temporal validation, drift monitoring, and model governance. This is the "practical ML floor": the skills that transfer directly from process-engineering discipline (SPC, reliability curves, maintenance scheduling) into applied ML roles, independent of any particular LLM.

---

## What It Does

- **Multi-horizon failure prediction** — Three separate calibrated Random Forest models score every asset across 10d, 30d, and 60d windows (LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH) based on 31 engineered features
- **60-day trajectory projection** — Forward-projects failure probability curves by analytically aging features at 7-day steps, with HIGH-threshold crossing detection
- **Cost model** — Identifies the optimal PM intervention day by comparing expected failure cost against scheduled maintenance cost, surfaced per-asset in the UI
- **Rental dispatch guard** — Blocks or warns dispatchers when HIGH/MEDIUM risk equipment is selected for a new rental, with mandatory risk acknowledgement for HIGH-risk dispatches
- **Fleet simulation engine** — Discrete-event simulator advances a cursor date, generates sensor readings, fires maintenance events via a Weibull-inspired hazard function, and handles fleet renewal (retirement + replacement) automatically
- **ML pipeline** — Full automated pipeline: feature snapshot generation → failure labeling → model training → inference, all triggerable from the admin UI
- **MLflow experiment tracking** — Every training run logs hyperparameters, per-horizon metrics (ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, recall, F1), per-fold CV scores, model artifacts, and feature importance JSONs under the `equipment-failure-multihorizon` experiment
- **SHAP explainability** — `TreeExplainer` runs at inference time; top 5 features by |SHAP value| are returned with every prediction for per-asset attribution
- **Three-layer drift detection** — Data drift (PSI on monitored features), prediction drift (distribution shift in 30d output scores), and bias drift (disparity in HIGH-rate across equipment categories); all persisted to `drift_metrics` table; dashboard surfaces per-feature PSI with STABLE / WARNING / ALERT status
- **Champion-challenger model governance** — Newly trained models enter registry as challengers; shadow-score every batch alongside champion without persisting results; admin promotes challenger to champion via `POST /api/ml/models/promote` with zero downtime (in-memory hot-swap); full audit history in `model_registry.json`
- **Pre-training data quality gate** — 8-check validator (row count, label completeness, class balance, null rates, physical bounds, non-zero required features, temporal spread, duplicate snapshots) blocks training on FAIL, warns on marginal data, PASS/WARN/FAIL summary in training log
- **Prevalence-honest calibration** — Random Forests calibrated (`CalibratedClassifierCV`) on the untouched, real-prevalence dev set with `class_weight='balanced'` (no SMOTE), so the emitted failure probability isn't inflated by resampling; Brier score + expected calibration error published per horizon
- **Agent API** — Bearer-token authenticated endpoints (`GET /api/agent/model-health`, `POST /api/agent/actions`) for programmatic and LLM agent access; returns consolidated health snapshot with machine-readable `recommended_action`
- **Automated monitoring** — `monitor.py` cron script polls model health, logs three-layer drift per feature, auto-triggers retraining or reference recomputation based on drift state, and fires Slack webhook alerts when action is needed or any drift layer reaches WARNING/ALERT; supports `--loop` mode for continuous polling
- **GenAI recommendations (opt-in)** — with `GENAI_RECOMMENDATIONS=on` and a provider key, the Groq LLM turns a single asset's structured risk facts (worst horizon, drivers) into plain-English maintenance prose, validated and falling back to a deterministic template on any failure; **off by default**, and batch scoring always uses the template
- **ML metrics dashboard** — Live feature importance, confusion matrix, per-class precision/recall/F1, prediction distribution over time, hyperparameter display, drift monitor card, champion-challenger comparison table, and data quality report card

## ML Models — v1.17

> **⚠️ Data source: simulated.** Every number below is **pipeline verification on synthetic data**,
> not field predictive performance. All operational data comes from a fleet simulator whose failure
> events were generated by age/wear hazard rules over (a subset of) the features the model consumes —
> so high AUC here demonstrates that the snapshot → label → train → serve plumbing is correct, and
> nothing more. See [docs/REAL_DATA_VALIDATION.md](docs/REAL_DATA_VALIDATION.md) for what has to
> happen before any metric can be quoted as predictive performance.

Three separate binary classifiers, one per prediction horizon. Each is a Random Forest calibrated on
the **real class prevalence** (no resampling — see calibration note below), trained on an embargoed
temporal holdout split with TimeSeriesSplit cross-validation, plus a by-asset grouped evaluation
(GroupKFold over equipment). One shared feature transform runs at train and serve time, and each
model serves its own version-pinned preprocessing artifacts.

**Training data:** 10,828 observed-outcome snapshots · 31 features · 2024–2032 simulation timeline
(45 rows censored for in-window predictive interventions, 630 horizon-censored). Labels derive only
from `REACTIVE_REPAIR` breakdown events in `(ts, ts+h]` — scheduled PM and model-driven
interventions are never counted as failures.

**v1.17 performance (simulated data):**

| Horizon | Split | ROC-AUC | PR-AUC | Recall @ HIGH | Brier | ECE |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 10d | temporal | 0.9272 | 0.8111 | 89.2% | 0.072 | 0.074 |
| 10d | by-asset | 0.9602 | — | — | — | — |
| 30d | temporal | 0.8823 | 0.8079 | 77.2% | 0.080 | **0.032** ✓ |
| 30d | by-asset | 0.9335 | — | — | — | — |
| 60d | temporal | 0.8024 | 0.7847 | 64.1% | 0.122 | 0.054 |
| 60d | by-asset | 0.9030 | — | — | — | — |

*(v1.17 = v1.16 + the ML-12 config fix — `maintenance_config.recommended_interval_days` now
actually drives `maint_overdue`/`neglect_score`. Both are low-importance features, so metrics are
within noise of v1.16; the point is that train and serve now compute them identically.)*

Recall @ HIGH = failure-class recall at the 0.60 HIGH-band operating threshold. ECE = expected
calibration error (gate: < 0.05). The **temporal split** answers "same fleet, next quarter"; the
**by-asset split** (every asset scored by a model that never saw it) answers "a new customer's fleet,
day one". Precision@budget and lead-time (operator metrics) are on the ML dashboard per horizon.

**Calibration (ML-5) — before/after dropping SMOTE.** SMOTE was applied before the calibrator, so it
fit on a ~50% synthetic prevalence and the emitted probability was systematically inflated. Measured
on the holdout (mean predicted probability − actual failure rate):

| Horizon | Inflation before (SMOTE) | Inflation after (no SMOTE) | ECE before → after |
|---|---|---|---|
| 10d | +0.025 | +0.073 | 0.027 → 0.074 |
| 30d | +0.085 | **+0.005** | 0.085 → **0.034** |
| 60d | +0.066 | **−0.001** | 0.066 → 0.053 |

Dropping SMOTE eliminates the resampling-driven inflation at 30d/60d (the 30d probability goes from
+8.5 points over-confident to essentially honest, and clears the ECE gate). The 10d row moves the
other way: its calibrator is fit on the 41%-positive dev set but the 10d holdout is only 22% positive
(the aging fleet shifts prevalence across the temporal boundary), so residual over-prediction there is
distribution shift, not resampling — the by-asset and CV numbers are the fairer read for 10d.

**Honest observations these numbers surface:**

- The 10d model's median lead time (~6 days) sits *below* the ~7-day PM scheduling latency — the
  30d model (26-day median lead) is the operationally actionable horizon.
- These metrics are substantially lower than the originally published v1.14 numbers
  (e.g. 30d holdout ROC-AUC 0.9297 → 0.8728, CV 0.9853 → 0.9232). The v1.14 numbers were inflated by
  three defects, all fixed from v1.15 on: feature windows unbounded by snapshot date (features could
  see the label event — ML-1), no embargo at the holdout boundary (ML-3), and a training set where
  52% of rows were snapshots of assets before they existed — trivially predictable filler (11,713 of
  22,585 rows, removed in regeneration).
- Positive rates (41–58%) are far above real fleet failure rates. That is the simulator's hazard
  process, and one more reason none of this is quotable as field performance.

**Evaluation methodology:** each horizon's holdout is a single **temporal** split (most recent ~20%
of snapshots) with a per-horizon **embargo** — dev rows whose label window `[ts, ts+h]` crosses the
holdout boundary are dropped (80/239/451 rows for 10/30/60d). 5-fold `TimeSeriesSplit` CV
(gap = horizon days) runs on the dev portion for a variance estimate. The **by-asset** numbers are
pooled out-of-fold predictions from `GroupKFold(5)` over `equipment_id`. Rows whose outcome window
contains a `PREDICTIVE_INTERVENTION` before any failure are **censored** (`label_status`), not
labeled negative — otherwise the model's own successes would poison its future labels.
**Retrain triggers:** `monitor.py` polls `/api/agent/model-health` and auto-triggers retraining when
any monitored feature's PSI reaches the ALERT threshold (≥ 0.20) or when prediction/bias drift
crosses the same threshold; an admin can also trigger retraining manually via `POST /api/ml/train`.

---

## Feature Engineering

31 features computed per asset per snapshot date from raw operational tables:

```
asset_age_years, rental_days_30d, rental_days_90d, avg_rental_duration,
maintenance_events_90d, days_since_last_maintenance, vendor_reliability_score,
jobsite_risk_score, usage_intensity, usage_trend, utilization_vs_expected,
wear_rate, aging_factor, maint_overdue, mechanical_wear_score, abuse_score,
neglect_score, wear_rate_velocity, maint_frequency_trend, cost_trend,
hours_velocity, neglect_acceleration, sensor_degradation_rate, category_encoded,
log_total_hours_lifetime, log_hours_used_30d, log_hours_used_90d,
log_maintenance_cost_180d, log_cost_per_event, log_maint_burden,
log_mean_time_between_failures
```

Seven skewed features are log-transformed at training and inference time. Derived columns (aging_factor, wear_rate, mechanical_wear_score, etc.) are recomputed fresh at inference rather than stored — avoids staleness from schema drift.

---

## ML Pipeline

All four stages are triggerable from the admin panel in the UI (ADMINISTRATOR role required):

```
1. Generate Snapshots   →  Backfills feature vectors across full simulation timeline (7-day intervals)
2. Label Snapshots      →  Marks 10d/30d/60d failure outcomes on each snapshot
3. Retrain Models       →  Trains v1.17+ models, hot-swaps on completion (~3 min)
4. Run Predictions      →  Scores all active fleet units with latest models
```

Training uses TimeSeriesSplit CV (5 folds, gap = horizon days) to prevent label leakage. Version is auto-incremented from the last DB record. Artifacts written to `ml-service/registry/`.

---

## Simulation Engine

A discrete-event simulator advances a cursor date day by day:

- **Sensor data** generated per equipment per day (engine temp, RPM, vibration, hydraulic pressure, etc.)
- **Maintenance events** fired probabilistically via a Weibull-inspired hazard function combining age hazard + hours hazard + neglect hazard
- **Fleet renewal** — equipment retired at age >10y OR (age >8y AND hours >8,000), replaced with `EQ-R{id}-{year}` pattern
- **Simulation cursor** — currently at 2032-04-08, 60 days run

## Testing

```bash
# Python — ml-service (115 tests: inference, training smoke test, data quality gate, model registry)
cd ml-service
pytest tests/ -v

# Node/TypeScript — server (unit tests for feature-engineering and risk-scoring core logic)
npm test

# TypeScript type-check
npx tsc --noEmit
```

All three run in CI (`.github/workflows/ml-ci.yml`) on every push/PR touching `ml-service/`, `server/`, `client/`, or `shared/`.

---

## Quickstart

### 1. Clone and configure

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd enterprise-asset-intelligence
cp .env.example .env
```

Fill in `.env`:

```env
DATABASE_URL=mysql://root:yourpassword@localhost:3306/asset_inventory
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=yourpassword
DB_NAME=asset_inventory
SESSION_SECRET=<openssl rand -hex 32>
GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_...
AGENT_API_KEY=<python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))">
```

> `DATABASE_URL` and the individual `DB_*` vars must point at the same database — the Node/Drizzle server reads `DATABASE_URL` (and will refuse to start without it), while the Python ML service reads the individual `DB_*` vars via SQLAlchemy.

### 2. Install and migrate

```bash
npm install
npm run db:migrate     # applies migrations/ — creates the full schema on a clean DB
```

Drizzle migrations (`shared/schema.ts` → `migrations/`) are the **single DDL owner**:
one `drizzle-kit migrate` builds every table (equipment, rentals, feature
snapshots, sensor logs, drift + model-metrics tables). The Node and Python
services only read and write — neither creates tables at runtime.

### 3. Start services

```bash
# Terminal 1 — Node API + Vite dev server
npm run dev

# Terminal 2 — ML service
cd ml-service
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn api.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

### 4. First-time setup (onboarding screen)

On first login, the app automatically redirects to `/setup`. Choose one of two paths:

**Load Demo Data** — recommended for evaluation and interviews. Runs the full seed pipeline in the background (~60–90 seconds) and streams live progress. Seeds:
- 10 heavy equipment units across four categories
- 90 days of sensor readings per asset
- Maintenance history with realistic failure events
- Trained multi-horizon ML model (10d / 30d / 60d)
- SHAP attribution, MLflow run, drift reference baseline

**Start Fresh** — skip demo data and build the dataset manually with real equipment and operational records. The dashboard surfaces guided empty states that walk you through adding equipment, logging maintenance, running the ML pipeline, and generating predictions in the right order.

> The onboarding screen re-appears any time the system is reset via `POST /api/admin/reset` (ADMINISTRATOR role only).

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | ✅ | Full MySQL DSN — read by the Node/Drizzle server. Must point at the same database as the `DB_*` vars below. |
| `DB_HOST` / `DB_PORT` / `DB_USER` / `DB_PASSWORD` / `DB_NAME` | ✅ | Individual MySQL connection vars — read by the Python ML service (SQLAlchemy) |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | ✅ | Express session signing key |
| `GROQ_API_KEY` | ✅ | Groq API key for LLM recommendations |
| `AGENT_API_KEY` | ✅ | Bearer token for agent API (`/api/agent/*`). Generate: `python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"` |
| `GROQ_MODEL` | — | Groq model ID (default: `llama-3.1-8b-instant`) |
| `LLM_PROVIDER` | — | `groq` or `ollama` (default: `groq`) |
| `MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI` | — | MLflow server URI. If unset, MLflow logging is skipped (safe no-op). |
| `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` | — | Incoming webhook URL for `monitor.py` alerts. If unset, Slack notifications are silently skipped. |
| `PYTHONIOENCODING` | — | Set to `utf-8` on Windows to avoid codec errors |

---

## Deployment Status

There is no hosted instance yet — Docker Compose (`docker-compose.yml`, three services: client, server, ml-service) is currently the only way to run the full stack, and `railway.toml` configs exist for the server and ML service but haven't been used for a live deployment. Getting a clickable demo online (frontend + Node API + FastAPI ML service + a free-tier MySQL host) is the next infrastructure step, tracked separately from this pass. Until then, use [Quickstart](#quickstart) to run everything locally — the "Load Demo Data" onboarding path seeds a full fleet with a trained model in under two minutes.

---

## Key Design Decisions

**Why three separate models instead of one multi-output model?**
Each horizon has a different positive rate (10d: 19.8%, 30d: 24.0%, 60d: 27.6%) and different optimal calibration (sigmoid for 10d, isotonic for 30d/60d). Separate models allow horizon-specific tuning and independent deployment.

**Why TimeSeriesSplit instead of random CV?**
Random CV leaks future data into training folds on temporal datasets. TimeSeriesSplit ensures each fold trains on past data only, which correctly simulates the deployment scenario.

**Why recompute derived features at inference instead of storing them?**
Storing derived columns (aging_factor, wear_rate, mechanical_wear_score) creates staleness risk — if the computation logic changes, stored values become inconsistent with what the model was trained on. Recomputing from raw inputs at inference keeps the feature pipeline as the single source of truth.

**Why a forward projection engine?**
Point-in-time predictions answer "what is the risk today?" The projection engine answers "when will this asset cross the HIGH threshold?" — which is the operationally useful question for scheduling maintenance windows.
